This is a program to practise the capitals of every country, in English.

It was before learning about multithreading on the GUI and also before starting to use classes the intended way.
It is quite a monolithic app, but still I wanted to share it.

You can execute the code with Program.cs or with the .exe file inside.

The music inside the program have reserved rights:
- Main menu music: Gusty Garden Galaxy - Nintendo, Mahito Yokota & Koji Kondo.
- Stage 1 background music: Try Try Again - Yoko Shimomura.
- Stage 2 background music: Rooftop Run Classic - Tomoya Ohtani & SEGA.
- Stage 3 background music: Moon Theme from Duck Tales - originally by Hiroshige Tonomura and expanded for The 8-Bit Big Band.
- Scoreboard entry: Victory in the Dream World - Yoko Shimomura.
